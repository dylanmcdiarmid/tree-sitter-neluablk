Going a bit broad today, sketching out a bunch of stuff straight out of the PEG.  Didn't really reference any other tree-sitters today, just trying to get a bunch of rules added with their corresponding PEG info. This will certainly leave everything in a broken state. Once most of the type declarations have a first pass done, it's likely I'll try and figure out a way to test those.
